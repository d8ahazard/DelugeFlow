# Privacy Policy for DelugeFlow

## Data Collection Policy

DelugeFlow is committed to protecting your privacy. We want to be absolutely clear about our data handling practices:

- **Zero Data Collection**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data whatsoever.
- **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics tools or tracking mechanisms.
- **No Third-Party Services**: We do not integrate with any third-party services that could collect your data.

## Data Usage

The only data processing that occurs within DelugeFlow happens:
1. Entirely within your local environment
2. Only when you explicitly configure and use the extension
3. Only with servers that YOU specify in the extension settings

## Server Communication

- Communication with torrent servers only occurs when:
  - You explicitly enable it in the settings
  - You manually configure your server details
  - You actively use features that require server communication

## Data Storage

- All configuration data is stored locally on your device
- No backups or copies of your data are ever created on external servers
- You have complete control over all data associated with the extension

## Future Commitment

We are committed to maintaining this strict privacy-first approach. This policy will never be altered to allow for data collection of any kind.
